I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Leadership & Organizational Behavior at BI Norwegian Business School. My research examines the role of emotions and emotion regulation in decisions involving risk and uncertainty. I am a big fan of open and reproducible science, and an avid user of {{< icon name="r-project" pack="fab" >}}. I set up the first ReproducibiliTea journal club in Norway, that I'm currently co-running with a colleague. The goal of our journal club is to raise awareness of open science and reproducibility (see "Projects" for more info). 

I am also a local node leader for Norway's Reproducibility Network {{< staticref "https://www.norrn.no/team" "newtab">}} (NORRN) {{< /staticref >}}.
