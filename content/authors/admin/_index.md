I recently completed my PhD in Organizational Psychology at the Department of Leadership & Organizational Behavior at BI Norwegian Business School. Broadly speaking, my research examines emotional and other socio-psychological factors in judgment and decision-making, with a focus on organizational settings. I am a big fan of open and reproducible science, and an avid user of {{< icon name="r-project" pack="fab" >}}. I set up the first ReproducibiliTea journal club in Norway, that I'm currently co-running with a colleague. The goal of our journal club is to raise awareness of open science and reproducibility (see "Projects" for more info). I am also a local node leader for Norway's Reproducibility Network {{< staticref "https://www.norrn.no/team" "newtab">}} (NORRN) {{< /staticref >}}.
