Hi! I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Leadership & Organizational Behavior at BI Norwegian Business School. I am also affiliated with Trope Lab at New York University's Department of Psychology (lab's website: https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/tropelab/about?authuser=0). My PhD project seeks to understand how emotions and psychological distance influence decisions involving risk and uncertainty. I am a big fan of open and reproducible science. I set up the first ReproducibiliTea journal club in Norway, that I'm currently co-running with a colleague. The goal of our journal club is to raise awareness of open science and reproducibility (see "Projects" for more info). I am also a local node leader for Norway's Reproducibility Network (NORRN; www.norrn.no).
