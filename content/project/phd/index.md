My PhD focuses on the influence of emotions and emotion regulation in decision-making under risk and uncertainty, largely focusing on organizational settings. 

A large body of research has shown that emotions play a key role in shaping people's judgments and decisions. However, people are also capable of regulating their emotions. One tactic of emotion regulation that has shown to be particularly promising is *self-distancing*. For instance, one might reflect on a negative or stressful situation from the perspective of a distant, impartial observer, or by focusing on the "bigger picture". In my PhD project, I examine how self-distancing, and psychological distance more generally, regulates the influence of emotions in decision-making. For instance, in one project, I examine how self-distancing regulates the influence of incidental emotions like fear and anger on risk taking and information processing (i.e., intuitive and analytical processing). In another project, I examine how managers who make decisions for others (vs. for themselves) process information and make decisions involving risk. 

Aside from my PhD research, I examine a range of topics, such as workplace stress and decision-making, social cognition, and overconfidence.

While I mainly use experiments to explore these questions, I often examine these questions on the trait level (i.e., individual differences). My overall research is guided by an interest in open science, which seeks to make the scientific process open, transparent, and reproducible.
