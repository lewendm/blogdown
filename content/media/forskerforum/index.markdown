Together with researchers at University of Oslo and Ã˜stfold University College, we wrote a short piece (in Norwegian) that announces the establishment of the Norwegian Reproducibility Network ( {{< staticref "https://www.norrn.no/" >}}NORRN{{< /staticref >}})â€”a national initiative aimed at improving the transparency and reproducibility of research in Norway. The article can be accessed {{< staticref "https://www.forskerforum.no/fram-for-troverdig-forskning/" >}} ðŸ‘‰ here {{< /staticref >}}.
